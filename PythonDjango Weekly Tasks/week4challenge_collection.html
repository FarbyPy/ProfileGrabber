<!-- Week2 Challenge: Build the Collections View
It seems that this page is completely missing, and we're not sure what to
do about it. If you're looking for a challenge, fix this page and make it
nice. Remember that the purpose of the page is to render a collection of
Twitter profiles that were saved in a database. If you want to learn more,
remember you can visit femto.cs.dal.ca/profileGrabber any time.-->

    <!-- Materialize has a special footer tag that renders a nice-looking footer.
    This looks fine for now. When we bring these into Django we should keep this
    one template that is used by all the pages, rather than rewriting it each time.-->
